# Correctness_ROIs
Matlab functions for use with visual world paradigm (VWP) eye-tracking experiments, with 2 or 4 regions of interest (ROIs).

Correct_MouseClick determines whether a mouse click selection is correct or not, based on a target word being displayed in one of either 2 or 4 ROIs. (It determines whether the mouse has, 1, or has not, 0, clicked within the ROI of the target word.)

DisplayWords displays two or four words on the screen, equal distances from the center, at the proportion specified (e.g. a third of the screen, a quarter of the screen from the edge).
